#### What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

There is a hidden directory that is created named `.git` which doesn't contain anything yet as no files are tracked
when you first create a repository.

#### How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is not a physical directory, it's a list of tracked files ready to be commited. 
Its value is in the fact that you can decide which of the files you are working on should be in the 
same commit to track a single logical change in your code.
